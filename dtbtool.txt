==============================

0) Document revision
   v1.0 - Initial version (dng)

1) Android boot image:
----------------------
1.1) Header:
   1) Magic (8B)
   2) kernel size (4B)
   3) kernel addr (4B)
   4) ramdisk size (4B)
   5) ramdisk addr (4B)
   6) 2ndary size (4B)
   7) 2ndary addr (4B)
   8) tags addr (4B)

  11) unused #2 (4B) (zero in standard Android)
  12) product name (16B)
  13) kernel cmdline (512B)
  14) id (8B)

1.2) Layout:
   A) header (as above - 1 page)
   B) kernel (n pages)
   C) ramdisk (m pages)
   D) second stage (o pages)

2) QC table of device tree
--------------------------
2.1) Changes:
   i) use "unused #1, #2" members in existing boot image
      header to point to new table of device tree
      (#1 - size of QC table of DT)
  ii) append table of device tree (described later)
      after "D) second stage"

2.2) Format:
                                 size

   |      | MAGIC ("QCDT")   |   4B

   |      +------------------+

 device   +------------------+

   |      +------------------+           to DTB entry)
   |      | size #1          |   uint32 (size in bytes of DTB blob)

3) Operations
-------------
3.1) Build-time:
  1) Each DTS per device will add a "qcom,msm-id" triplet
     e.g. for msm8974-sim.dts, add
          qcom,msm-id = <x y z>;
     x = ID for msm8974
     y = ID for CDP, MTP, etc.
     z = ID for soc revision
     The triplet can optionally be an array of triplets:
         qcom,msm-id = <x1, y1, z1>, <x2, y2, z2>, ...;
  2) Kernel compile will generate the DTB
  3) Android build will run a new tool (dtbTool)
     a) scan the DTB output directory for all compiled DTB
     b) decompile the DTB for "qcom,msm-id"
     c) generate the QC table of device tree in sorted
        order (platform, variant, soc rev)
     d) modified mkbootimg will merge new table of DT

3.2) Run-time:
  1) LK bootloader will obtain MSM id/variant/soc rev info
     either from early bootloaders or via other means
  2) LK bootloader will check entries #10 for non-zero
     value (set to zero for standard boot.img).  If the
     value is non-zero, refer to page section after
     the "second stage" in the boot.img layout
  3) Check QCDT magic
  4) Check QCDT version (optional LK to handle multiple
     QCDT version)
  5) LK scans through the QCDT table to look for matching
     entry.  Search order is:
     1) platform ID exact match
     2) variant ID exact match
     3) select the highest soc rev in QCDT that is
        equal to or lower than the runtime detected soc rev
  6) Load the matching DTB blob to the tags addr
  7) LK pass the correct DTB to the kernel
